In the designing I was inspired by the novel and movie "The Fourth Protocol" Â© from Frederick Forsyth & John Mckenzie, the book explains very well how the otp sheet works, and the movie contains an scene where an otp sheet is used. I would like to thank them and Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan and all the crew for his great work. I love the scenes at the disco, where Brosnan dance together with Betsy Brantley, as they seem to enjoy more than acting.

As password generator it relays on the user selected parameters for it's strength, so user must take care of desired security level.

As new word generator sometimes outputs pronounceable words without signification, some tests as been done by searching on the web, where found pronounceable words with zero hits on searchers, for example. Doing this is an amazing task as there is a plenty of new words to be discovered, take your time and have fun.
