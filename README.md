This code is intended to use for training purposes only, must be used in a isolated computer system not conected to a network. If ... it is possible today?

The author does not accept any responsibility in any way for their use, and the user is responsible of use it for testing purposes only
in a private owned computer system, also must not fully trust the output given by this software if the correct security measures have not been taken, as both the code and the Red language itself still under development.

User must be warned to care of system lock if control parameters are raised to their limits, or to a limit out of the bounds of the
computing power on the host computer system.

Use of output given by this software is a powerful secrecy messaging system (if well used), the author does not accept any responsibility in any way for their use or manipulation, use them at your risk. In the designing I was inspired by the novel and movie "The Fourth Protocol" Â© from Frederick Forsyth & John Mckenzie, the book explains very well how the otp sheet works, and the movie contains an scene where an otp sheet is used. I would like to thank them (I am a great Forsyth's fan), Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan and all the crew for his great work.

As password generator it relays on the user selected parameters for it's strength, so user must take care of desired security level.

As new word generator sometimes outputs pronounceable words without signification, some tests as been done by searching on the web, where found pronounceable words with zero hits. Doing this is an amazing task as there is a plenty of new words to be discovered, take your time and have fun.
